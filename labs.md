**Follow the startup instructions in the README.md file IF NOT ALREADY DONE!**

**NOTE: To copy and paste in the codespace, you may need to use keyboard commands - CTRL-C and CTRL-V. Chrome may work best for this.**

**NOTE: You may see periodic "Reconnecting" messages pop up. This is normal and they will go away shortly.**

**NOTE: To get a closer view of the LM Studio App, you can click on the *View* menu at the top and then click on *Zoom In*.**

**Lab 1 - Working with Neural Networks**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll learn more about neural networks by seeing how one is coded and .**

1. In our repository, we have a simple neural net coded in Python. The file name is simple_nn.py. Open the file either by clicking on [**gen-ai-dd/simple-nn.py**](./gen-ai-dd/simple-nn.py) or by entering the command below in the codespace's terminal.

```
code simple_nn.py
```

2. Notice the *training_inputs* data and the *training_outputs* data. Each row of the *training_outputs* is what we want the model to predict for the corresponding input row. As coded, the output for the input is just the first element of the array.  For inputs [0,0,1] we are trying to train the model to predict [0]. For the inputs [1,0,1], we are trying to train the model to predict [1], etc.

3. When we run the program, it will train the neural net to try and predict the outputs corresponding to the inputs. You will see the random training weights to start and then the adjusted weights to make the model predict the output. You will then be prompted to put in your own training data. We'll look at that in the next step. For now, go ahead and run the program (command below) but don't put in any inputs yet.

```
python simple_nn.py
```
4. What you should see is that the weights after training are now set in a way that makes it more likely that the result will match the expected output value. To prove this out, you can enter your own input set - just use 1's and 0's for each input. 

5. After you put in your inputs, the neural net will process your input and because of the training, it should predict a result that is close to the first input value you entered (the one for *Input one*).

6. Now, let's see what happens if we change the expected outputs to be different. In the editor for the simple_nn.py file, find the line for the *training_outputs*. Modify the values in the array to be ([[0],[1],[0],[1]]]). These are the values of the second element in each of the training data entries. After you're done, save your changes.

7. Now, run the neural net again. This time when the weights after training are shown, you should see a bias for a higher weight for the second item.
```
python simple_nn.py
```

8. At the input prompts, just input any sequence of 0's and 1's as before.

9. When the trained model then processes your inputs, you should see that it predicts a value that is close to 0 or 1 depending on what your second input was.

10. If you get done early, feel free to try other combinations of training inputs and training outputs.
    
12. , run the script *./getlink.sh*. This will output a link that you can click on to get to the LM Studio instance. Use *Ctrl/Cmd+Click* to open the browser session. 

![Getting to LM Studio](./images/dga08b.png?raw=true "Getting to LM Studio") 

</br></br>
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: Alternate method to get to LM Studio (only need to use if having trouble with above - otherwise, go to Step 2):*

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on the *PORTS* tab (next to *TERMINAL*) in the lower part of the codespace screen. Hover the mouse over the *globe* icon and click on it to open up a new browser tab running noVNC.* 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Getting to LM Studio](./images/dga58.png?raw=true "Getting to LM Studio")

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then click on the *Connect* button.*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![Getting to LM Studio](./images/dga59.png?raw=true "Getting to LM Studio")

</br></br>

2. After that, you should see the running instance of LM Studio. You'll probably be at the *Release Notes* screen. Just click the *Close* button.

![LM Studio instance](./images/dga10.png?raw=true "LM Studio instance")   

3. Scroll around the home page of the app to see the examples of recent models featured there. When done, just scroll back up to the top.

![LM Studio models on home page](./images/dga41.png?raw=true "LM Studio models on home page")


4. Now we're going to search using LM Studio for a particular model - *llama*. Enter *llama* into the search bar and then click the *Go* button.
```
llama
```

![llama search](./images/dga11a.png?raw=true "llama search")   

5. After the search is run, you'll see a list of *llama* models displayed on the left and different versions of them displayed on the right. You can hover over some of the items like the *Q* identifiers in the items on the right to get more info.

![llama model info](./images/dga12a.png?raw=true "llama model info")  

6. LM Studio also displays some information to help you decide about which model version to use. There's an expandable section near the bottom under *Learn more*. Click to expand that and you read more about the differences in quantization level.

![Learning more](./images/dga13a.png?raw=true "Learning more")  

7. You can also expand the README about the model to get more details about it's attributes, license, etc. To do that, click on the expand button in the row for *README.md* and scroll through its contents.

![Viewing the README](./images/dga15a.png?raw=true "Viewing the README") 

8. Now, let's actually download one of the models. Back in the list, collapse the expanded *README* and *Learn more* sections. In the left column, select the row for the *TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF* file. In the right column, select the row for the *llama-2-7b-chat.Q3_K_M.gguf* file and click the *Download* button. You'll see a progress bar at the bottom of the screen and an indication in the row when it is completely downloaded.

![Downloading the model](./images/dga16.png?raw=true "Downloading the model") 
![Downloaded the model](./images/dga17.png?raw=true "Downloaded the model")

9. Now let's take a look at the model we downloaded on the community site https://huggingface.co/models. Open that link in a separate tab and you'll see some of the different types of models and various models available for download and use.
![huggingface](./images/dga18.png?raw=true "huggingface")

10. In the search bar on https://huggingface.co/models, enter enough of the name of the model *thebloke/llama-2-* and select the page for the model *TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF*.

![finding the model repo](./images/dga19a.png?raw=true "finding the model repo")

11. You'll now be on the *model card* page for *TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF* repository. You can scroll down and find additional details, directions for use, example uses, etc. about the models in this repository.

![exploring the model repo](./images/dga20a.png?raw=true "exploring the model repo")

12. You can also take a look at the *Files and versions* page.

</br></br>

**Lab 2 - Chatting with our model**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to load and interact with the model through chat and terminal.**

1. First, let's switch to the *AI Chat* interface in LM Studio by clicking on the third icon from the top in the left bar.
   
![Switching to chat](./images/dga22.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")

2. Now, at the top center of the *AI Chat* screen, click on the down arrow next to the *Select a model to load* text and select the *llama* model we downloaded.
   
![Switching to chat](./images/dga23a.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")
  
3. You should see a progress bar while the model is loading and then the model should show up as loaded. (If a dialog box comes up about the System Prompt, you can just choose to accept the new one.)
![Switching to chat](./images/dga24.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")
![Switching to chat](./images/dga25a.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")

4. Over in the right-hand side window, you can explore the different options. Change the *System Prompt* field to be:
```
You are an excellent summarizer. Always answer with 3 key points.
```
![Switching to chat](./images/dga26a.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")

5. Now, let's give our loaded model a query. In the *USER* text entry area, enter your query. (An example one is shown, but you can choose your own.)
   
![User query](./images/dga27a.png?raw=true "User query")

6. Example output from the sample query is shown below. Note that if you don't like the answer, you can click the *Regenerate* button to get another answer.
![Switching to chat](./images/dga28b.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")

7. Now, let's have LM Studio run a local server for this model. In the lefthand bar, select the next to bottom icon for the *Local Server* screen.
![Switching to chat](./images/dga29.png?raw=true "Switching to chat")

8. On the *Local Server* screen, click on the green *Start Server* button on the left side. Afterwards, you should see activity showing the server is running.
![Starting server](./images/dga30a.png?raw=true "Starting server")
![Server running](./images/dga43.png?raw=true "Server running")

9. Now, switch back to your codespace and go to a terminal. (You can add a 2nd terminal if you want via the "+" icon over in the far right of the same line as TERMINAL. Or you can right-click and select New Terminal* or *Split Terminal*.) In the terminal's command line, let's check to see which model(s) are loaded in LM Studio. You can use the following command.
```
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models
```
10. Finally, let's try a simple query with curl. Try the query below.
```
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "messages": [ 
      { "role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes." },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself." }
    ], 
    "temperature": 0.7, 
    "max_tokens": -1,
    "stream": true
}'
```
11. To see the output in a more readable format, set the *stream* value to *false* and run the command again.
```
curl http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ 
    "messages": [ 
      { "role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes." },
      { "role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself." }
    ], 
    "temperature": 0.7, 
    "max_tokens": -1,
    "stream": false
}'
```

**Lab 3 - Coding to LM Studio**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to do some simple Python and JavaScript code to interact with the model.**

1. While we got output from the last step of lab 2, it wasn't very useful in that form. Let's use the pre-configured python environment to do some simple coding in. 

2. Now, let's create a new file called *simple-app.py* to put our code in.
```
code simple-app.py
```

3. Enter the code below in the *simple-app.py* file and then save when done. (Again, you can change the *content* strings to whatever you want.)
```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="n-a")

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="local-model",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Always answer in rhymes."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Introduce yourself."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```
![Saving file](./images/dga60.png?raw=true "Saving file")

4. Now, run the program to see the output.
```
python simple-app.py
```
![output of run](./images/dga61.png?raw=true "Output of run")

5. Let's see what effect changing the temperature value has. Change the value for temperature in the program to 2.0 and then run the program again. (You can also change the prompt if you want. In this example, I changed it to "How do I build a house?"). Make sure to save your changes before running!

![output of run with temp = 2](./images/dga63.png?raw=true "Output of run with temp = 2")

6. Next, we'll switch to doing a simple example in JavaScript for LM Studio. First, switch to a new terminal by using one of the methods mentioned previously.

7. We need to *bootstrap* things for LM Studio by setting up the *lms* command line tool. Run the following command in the terminal.
```
~/.cache/lm-studio/bin/lms bootstrap
```
![bootstrapping lms](./images/dga32.png?raw=true "bootstrapping lms")

8. Rerun your profile file and make sure that *lms* runs there.
```
source /home/vscode/.profile
lms
```
![checking lms](./images/dga33.png?raw=true "checking lms")

9. Use the *lms* command to create a new empty project, run through it's interactive process, and then switch to it.
```
lms create node-javascript-empty
cd <project-name>
```
![creating new lms project](./images/dga65.png?raw=true "Creating new lms project")

10. Now, you can replace the code in your *src/index.js* file with the code below. You can open the file from the terminal via the first command below. (You can change the system and/or user *role* and *content* if you want.) Be sure to save your changes before running.

```
code src/index.js
```
</br>
    
```
// index.js
const { LMStudioClient } = require("@lmstudio/sdk");

async function main() {
  // Create a client to connect to LM Studio, then load a model
  const client = new LMStudioClient();
  const model = await client.llm.load("TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/llama-2-7b-chat.Q3_K_M.gguf");

  // Predict!
  const prediction = model.respond([
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful AI assistant." },
    { role: "user", content: "What is some good advice?" },
  ]);
  for await (const text of prediction) {
    process.stdout.write(text);
  }
}

main();
```

11. Save your changes if you haven't and then let's run the code!
```
npm  start
```

**Lab 4 - Working with models in Hugging Face**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll see how to get more information about, and work directly with, models in Hugging Face.**

1. In a browser, go to *https://huggingface.co/models*.

2. Let's search for another simple model to try out. In the search bar, enter the text *DialoGPT*. Look for and select the *microsoft/DialoGPT-medium* model.
  ![model search](./images/dga44.png?raw=true "model search")

3. Let's see how we can quickly get up and running with this model. On the *Model Card* page for the *microsoft/DialoGPT-medium* model, if you scroll down, you'll see a *How to use* section with some code in it. Highlight that code and copy it so we can paste it in a file in our workspace.

![code to use model](./images/dga45.png?raw=true "code to use model")
   
4. Switch back to your codespace. Create a new file named dgpt-med.py (or whatever you want to call it). Paste the code you copied from the model card page into the file. You can create the new file from the terminal using:

```
code dgpt-med.py
```
![adding code](./images/dga46.png?raw=true "adding code")

5. Don't forget to save your file. Now you can run your file by invoking it with python. You'll see it start to download the files associated with the model. This will take a bit of time to run.
```
python dgpt-med.py
```
![running the model](./images/dga47.png?raw=true "running the model")

6. After the model loads, you'll see a *>> User:* prompt. You can enter a prompt or question here, and after some time, the model will provide a response.  **NOTE** This model is small and old and does not provide good responses usually or even ones that make sense. We are using it as a simple, quick demo only.

```
>> User: <prompt here>
```
![running the model](./images/dga48.png?raw=true "running the model")

7. Let's now switch to a different model. Go back to the Hugging Face search and look for *phi3-vision*. Find and select the entry for *microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct*.
![finding the phi3-vision model](./images/dga49.png?raw=true "finding the phi3-vision model")

8. Switch to the *Files and versions* page to see the sizes of the files in the Git repository. Note the larger sizes of the model files themselves.
![examining the model files](./images/dga53.png?raw=true "examining the model files")

9. Now, let's see how we can try this model out with no setup on our part. Go back to the *Model card* tab, and scroll down to the *Resources and Technical Documentation* section. Under that, select the entry for *Phi-3 on Azure AI Studio*.
![Invoking model on Azure AI Studio](./images/dga54.png?raw=true "Invoking the model on Azure AI Studio")

10. This will start up a separate browser instance of Azure AI Studio with the model loaded so you can query it. In the prompt area, enter in a prompt to have the AI describe a picture. You can upload one, enter the URL of one on the web, or use the example one suggested below. After you submit your prompt, the model should return a description of the photo. (If you get a response like *"Sorry I can't assist with that."*, refresh the page and try again.)
```
Describe the image at https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1364253107/photo/dog-and-cat-as-best-friends-looking-out-the-window-together.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=is&k=20&c=Do171m5e2DbPIlWDs1JfHn-g8Et_Hxb2AskHg4cRYY4=

**Lab 5 - Using Ollama to run models locally**

**Purpose: In this lab, weâ€™ll start getting familiar with Ollama, another way to run models locally.**

1. First, to get *ollama* downloaded, execute the command below. Then you can run the actual application to see usage.
```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```
![downloading ollama](./images/dga36.png?raw=true "downloading ollama")

2. Next, start the ollama server running with the following command:
```
ollama serve &
```
![downloading ollama](./images/dga37.png?raw=true "downloading ollama")

3. Now let's find a model to use.
Go to https://ollama.com and in the *Search models* box at the top, enter *llava*.
![searching for llava](./images/dga39.png?raw=true "searching for llava")

4. Click on the first entry to go to the specific page about this model. Scroll down and scan the various information available about this model.
![reading about llava](./images/dga40a.png?raw=true "reading about llava")

5. Switch back to a terminal in your codespace. While it's not necessary to do as a separate step, first pull the model down with ollama. (This will take a few minutes.)
```
ollama pull llava
```
6. Now you can run it with the command below.
```
ollama run llava
```
7. Now you can query the model by inputting text at the *>>>Send a message (/? for help)* prompt. Since this is a multimodal model, you can ask it about an image too. Try the following prompt that references a smiley face file in the repo.
```
What's in this image?  images/smiley.jpg
```
![smiley face analysis](./images/dga64a.png?raw=true "Smiley face analysis")

8. Now, let's try a call with the API. You can stop the current run with a Ctrl-D or switch to another terminal. Then put in the command below. 
```
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llava",
  "prompt": "What causes wind?",
  "stream": false
}'
```

9. This will take a minute or so to run. You should a single response object returned. You can try out some other prompts/queries if you want.

**Lab 6 - Building a chatbot with Streamlit**

**Purpose: In this lab, we'll see how to use the Streamlit application to create a simple chatbot with Ollama.**

1. Let's get another model to work with - a small one. Pull the *Phi3 mini* model with Ollama.
```
ollama pull phi3:mini
```

2. Create a new file for the chatbot app.
```
code chatapp.py
```

3. In the chatapp.py file, add the initial imports we need for streamlit and ollama
```
import streamlit as st
# import ollama wrapper
import ollama
```

4. Now, we set the title and initialize the session messages. (You can change the title and "content" sections if you want.)
```
st.title("DIY Gen AI Chatbot")
# check messages variable in streamlit's session state
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
      # if no value set, (we're just starting out) then initialize with friendly message
      # role is either "user" or "assistant"
      st.session_state["messages"] = [ {"role":  "assistant",  "content":  "What can I help you with?"}]
```
5. Add code to write the msg history
```
# Write msg history
for msg in st.session_state.messages:
       st.chat_message(msg["role"]).write(msg["content"])
```

6. Now, add the generator function for responses
```
# Generator for streaming tokens
def generate_response():
        # call chat function in ollama, get response from the loaded model
        response = ollama.chat(model='phi3:mini', stream=True, messages=st.session_state.messages)
        for partial_resp in response:
               token = partial_resp["message"]["content"]
               # maintain history/context
               st.session_state["full_message"] += token
               yield token
```

7. Finally, add the code to save the messages and call the generator function

```
if prompt := st.chat_input():
      # save the message for the user role
      st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
      st.chat_message("user").write(prompt)
      st.session_state["full_message"] = ""
      # call the generate_response function above
      st.chat_message("assistant").write_stream(generate_response)
      # save the message for the assistant role
      st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": st.session_state["full_message"]})
```

8. Now, save your file and run it with the following command. (You can just ignore the email field.)
```
streamlit run chatapp.py
```

9. After a moment this should open up a browser session with your chatbot running. You can ask it a question or prompt it as you want.
![interacting with chatbot](./images/dga50.png?raw=true "interacting with chatbot")

10. One other thing you can try if you want is having it generate code or translate code. Notice that it has a "memory" between questions for context.
